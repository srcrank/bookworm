# Front End Capstone for NSS Cohort 47
## Bookworm
### Background
Bookworm was born out of a desire to be able to keep track of all of the books I have read and plan to read. I always seem to be in the middle of reading 5 books at any given time, and run into the issue of having bookshelves filled with books that are half finished or untouched. I quickly found myself wanting an app where I could keep track of all of those titles, and set goals for myself - especially an app that had a clean design. 
Other apps that attempt to do the same end up overcluttered with too many features that make them confusing to use and look at. Bookworm seeks to solve this problem by existing specifically for the individual user. 
The user can, once registered, set goals for themselves, add books to the database, add books to their personal library, and recommend titles to other users in a small forum.
